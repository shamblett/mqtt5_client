///
/// First create a client, the client is constructed with a broker name, client identifier
/// and port if needed. The client identifier (short ClientId) is an identifier of each MQTT
/// client connecting to an MQTT broker. As the word identifier already suggests, it should be unique per client connection.
/// The broker uses it for identifying the client and the current state(session) of the client.
///
/// If a port is not specified the standard port of 1883 is used.
///
/// If you want to use websockets rather than TCP see below. A separate example(mqtt5_server_client_secure.dart')
/// shows how to set up and use secure sockets on the server.

/// Connect to a resolvable host that is not running a broker, hence the connection will fail.
/// Set the maximum connection attempts to 3.
