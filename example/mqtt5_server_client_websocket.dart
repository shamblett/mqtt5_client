/// An annotated simple subscribe/publish usage example for mqtt5_server_client using websockets.
/// Please read in with reference to the MQTT specification. The example is runnable, also refer to
/// test/mqtt5_client_broker_test...dart files for separate subscribe/publish tests.

/// First create a client, the client is constructed with a broker name, client identifier
/// and port if needed. The client identifier (short ClientId) is an identifier of each MQTT
/// client connecting to an MQTT broker. As the word identifier already suggests, it should be unique per client connection.
/// The broker uses it for identifying the client and the current state(session) of the client.
///
/// If a port is not specified the standard port of 1883 is used.
///

/// A websocket URL must start with ws:// or wss:// or Dart will throw an exception, consult your websocket MQTT broker
/// for details.
final client = MqttServerClient('ws://test.mosquitto.org', '');

  /// setter, read the API docs for further details here, the vast majority of brokers will support the client default
  /// list so in most cases you can ignore this.
  /// client.websocketProtocols = ['myString'];

  /// Set logging on if needed, defaults to off

  /// a positive value other than 0.

  /// Add the successful connection callback
  client.onConnected = onConnected;

  /// Add a subscribed callback, there is also an unsubscribed callback if you need it.
  /// You can add these before connection or change them dynamically after connection if
  /// you wish. There is also an onSubscribeFail callback for failed subscriptions, these
  /// can fail either because you have tried to subscribe to an invalid topic or the broker
  /// rejects the subscribe request.
