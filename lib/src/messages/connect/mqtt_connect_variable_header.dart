  /// to ensure that the interval between MQTT Control Packets being sent does
  /// not exceed the Keep Alive value. If Keep Alive is non-zero and in the
  /// absence of sending any other MQTT Control Packets,
  /// the client MUST send a ping request.
  ///
  /// If the Keep Alive value is non-zero and the broker does not receive an MQTT
  /// Control Packet from the client within one and a half times the Keep Alive
  /// time period, it MUST close the network connection to the client
  /// as if the network had failed.
  ///
  /// A Keep Alive value of 0 has the effect of turning off the Keep Alive mechanism.
  /// If Keep Alive is 0 the client is not obliged to send MQTT Control Packets
  /// on any particular schedule.

  /// it is shutting down. Setting Keep Alive does not guarantee that the
  /// client will remain connected.
